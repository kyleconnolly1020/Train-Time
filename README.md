# Train-Time

Welcome to Platorm 9 3/4. This app is meant to take in user inputs in the form, hold the data in a firebase database, and display the relevant info in the Current Train Schedule. 

With the inputs, the app will also calculate when the next available train will be arriving, as well as how many minutes away the train is. 

In the case of Hogwarts Station, the trains are always on time and run once every specified frequency, because...Magic ya know?
